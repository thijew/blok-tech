# Interface

Create a wireframe (lo-fi/high-fi) to sketch out how your interface should look. If you want you can also apply design and styling and create a full blown visual interface but you don't want to spend too much time creating visual designs.

You'll probably want to turn your screens into a wireflow to get a feel for the flow of the application and how a user navigates your features and parts of your application.
